# 🎨 Background Color Changer 

## 📌 What Is This Project?
we will build a simple web project to understand:

- Basic HTML structure
- How JavaScript adds behavior to a webpage
- How Git pull works
- How real developers incrementally build features

We will NOT write everything at once.

Instead, we will:
1. Pull HTML first
2. Run it (nothing happens)
3. Pull JavaScript
4. See the magic
5. Improve it ourselves

# 🟢 Step 1: Pull HTML Version

In your terminal, run:

git pull

This will download the latest version of the project.

---

## ▶️ How To Run (HTML Only)

Inside the project folder, run:

start index.html

This opens the file in your browser.

Click the button.

👉 Nothing happens.

Why?

Because HTML provides structure, but no behavior.

---

# 🟢 Step 2: Pull JavaScript Version

Now run:

git pull

This will pull the updated version that includes `script.js`.

Open `index.html` again:

start index.html

Click the button.

🎉 Now the background changes!

JavaScript added behavior to the webpage.
